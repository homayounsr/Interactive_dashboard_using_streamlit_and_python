# Interactive Dashboard with streamlit library
In this project, I have created an interactive dashboard for a supermarket sales dataset and extracted insights and patterns from it. This dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for users to explore the data and gain valuable insights into supermarket sales. I utilized the Plotly Express framework to create interactive plots and visualizations.

## What are the options of this dashboard?
This dashboard created from three main parts including:
1) Sidebar
2) Total KPIs
3) Charts

## Sidebar
The sidebar features five different sorting options, encompassing all categorical variables present in the dataset. This functionality enables users to sort and filter the dataset based on their specific requirements. For example, if you wish to view the income of branch A for female members, you can easily select these criteria from the sidebar, and voil√†!
